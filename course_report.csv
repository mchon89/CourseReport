Metis,/schools/metis,New York City,Data Visualization With D3.js,2 750,Data Science  JavaScript  HTML  Git  CSS,Data Visualization With D3.js is a part-time evening course was developed and is currently taught by Kevin Quealy  Graphics Editor at The New York Times.    This is a course about data visualization and D3  the powerful Javascript library frequently used to create data visualizations on the web. We use the library extensively at the Times – its creator  Mike Bostock  was a colleague for three years.    D3 can be challenging to learn  and lots of the difficulty comes with learning syntax and understanding data joins  probably the most fundamental aspect of D3. On top of that  there are the headaches associated with what Hadley Wickham has called the "fiddly bits" of charts: scales  axes  labels  annotations and the like. These basically come for free with software like Excel  R  Chartbuilder or Data Wrapper  but with D3 you're in charge of every pixel  which makes it incredibly powerful.    Ultimately  the reason to learn D3 instead of or in addition to those other (great!) programs is because it enables you to tell stories and communicate information interactively in ways that are simply not possible outside a web browser. Making these kinds of applications is worth a little bit of extra headaches up front.    WHO IS THIS COURSE FOR?    This is a course for anyone who wants to be proficient in the use of D3 and seeks expertise visualizing quantitative information.

Coderversity,/schools/coderversity,Online,Salesforce Cloud Development,8 500,JavaScript  Git  Java  Sales,Have you ever heard of Salesforce  SFDC  or Force.com? If you haven’t  then more than likely  you have also never heard of cloud computing or cloud-based development. Well  Salesforce is the current leader in cloud computing due to their groundbreaking CRM  Force.com. As you very well know  when a certain technology booms  so does job growth. Companies love the cloud because it’s usually cheaper to maintain  and nowadays  it’s a lot safer and more efficient as resources are managed elsewhere.    This 24-week course introduces students to two different worlds: Core Java and Apex/Visualforce Development. Since Apex  Salesforce’s cloud-based object-oriented programming language  is very similar to Java  we begin the course with several weeks of Java training. Then  we transition to Force.com development and administration. Finally  as usual  you’ll have a Milestone Project to complete.

Although the emphasis is on the digital aspect of user experience (websites  apps)  UX also applies to services and products.   	Hiring managers need UX designers. Because of a wide range of companies with a digital presence  there is a heavy demand for UX designers who can design the way a website flows  the placement of buttons on a mobile interface  the clarity and readability of the accompanying language—all of these things and more affect a user’s experience of a brand and its products. A UX designer’s job is to make sure that the user’s experience is as pleasant as possible.    Location: 356 Seventh Ave (at West 30th). Chelsea  New York City.

Students will learn the fundamentals of digital design including layout (grid)  space  color  typography  and the tools used by designers to create visual designs (Sketch  Illustrator  Photoshop). Students will be exposed to Bootstrap (CSS Framework)  as well as some advanced topics like mobile design  interaction design  and animation    Patterns & Pattern Libraries  Students will build on what they learned in the Visual Design Fundamentals & Tools course to understand how design elements fit into design organisms  and even larger design systems that represent a brand. The students will also learn about pattern libraries and how to build one.      Mobile Devices  Students will explore the eccentricities of designing for small screens and touch devices. Objectives include understanding user context/environment  utilizing the hardware available in mobile devices for a better user experience (gps  camera  etc.)  and the user experience differences between a click paradigm on a desktop/laptop versus the touch interaction (touch  gesture) on a mobile device.    Presentation/Communicating Design  Students will learn how to present their design and prototype concepts to a group. This includes creating a presentation  speaking to a group  accepting criticism  iterating a design based on feedback  and defending design decisions.          Wireframing  Students will discover how to utilize wireframing to visualize a concept and the tools used to wireframe (Balsamiq  drawing  Axure). Students will also learn the difference between a wireframe versus a prototype  and how to utilize wireframes in user testing and presentations.    Prototyping  Objectives for this course include integrating visual design into a functional prototype  the differences in fidelity for prototypes (low  medium  high)  and the tools used for prototyping (invision  axure  code) depending on fidelity required. Students will also understand how to use prototyping in user testing and iterate a prototype based on testing feedback.    Advanced Research/Testing & Iteration/Reporting  This course builds upon the knowledge gained from the introduction to user experience course which touches on research. Students will learn the tools and objectives for usability testing  the usability testing process  the types of usability testing  recruiting test subjects  qualitative research  quantitative research  iteration and retesting  and how to report on the results of usability tests.  Current Trends & Tools  Students will explore current trends and tools in user experience today. This includes popular design styles  popular user experience patterns  popular tools used in user experience practice  and examples of good versus bad user experiences in digital products.    Team organization and structure  This is a one meeting course that describes the makeup of a user experience team typically found in a corporation or agency. Students will discover the roles and responsibilities of each team member and the processes used to create great products    Intro to Digital Marketing  This course is an overview of digital marketing in the context of user experience. User experience includes the entire customer journey from initial customer contact to customer engagement with the product and customer exit  thus marketing initiates the conversation with users and maintains user loyalty. With this in mind  students will get an overview of digital marketing techniques and tools and how user experience professionals can use digital marketing to create a top-notch user experience for a digital product.    First Project  Students will utilize the knowledge gained throughout the user experience curriculum to independently develop a project that incorporates the key elements of the user experience learnings. This project will be done throughout the duration of the curriculum  with several classes devoted to work sessions where students can interact with each other and the professor to better their project.    After the first month of training  you are already building your reume with an Internship  and real world products. By the time you finish the program  you will have a professional portfolio  and three to five finished projects.
